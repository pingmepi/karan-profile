# Kinetic Geometry Design System
> "Order through mathematical joy and dynamic assembly."

## 1. ✨ Visual Design Principles

*   **Constructive Play:** The interface is not just a static display; it is a playground. Elements should feel tangible, stackable, and capable of interaction.
*   **Geometric Truth:** Design is built from fundamental primitives—**Circles, Squares, Triangles**. No decoration, only structure.
*   **Kinetic Energy:** Motion is physics-based. Gravity, collision, and momentum replace standard "ease-in-out" CSS transitions.
*   **Radical Contrast:** Rejection of subtle gradients. We use absolute blacks, stark whites, and punchy primary colors.
*   **Grid as Game Board:** The layout grid is visible and acts as the "rules" of the system, but elements can break free.

## 2. 🎨 Color Palette (The Bauhaus Set)

| Role | Color Name | Hex | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Canvas** | **Gallery White** | `#F2F0E9` | Main background. Warm, paper-like off-white. |
| **Ink** | **Construct Black** | `#121212` | Text, borders, structural lines. |
| **Primary** | **Klein Blue** | `#002FA7` | Key actions, header backgrounds, large shapes. |
| **Accent A** | **Signal Red** | `#FF2400` | Errors, alerts, or high-impact highlights. |
| **Accent B** | **Bauhaus Yellow**| `#FFD700` | Decorative geometry, hover states. |

> **Dark Mode Strategy:** Inverts Canvas to `#121212` and Ink to `#F2F0E9`. Primary colors remain vibrant to pop against the dark.

## 3. 🔠 Typography System

We use a pairing of an eccentric "Art School" display font with a highly geometric utilitarian sans-serif.

| Element | Font | Weight | Characteristics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Display (H1, H2)** | **Syne** | Extra Bold (800) | Unconventional, wide distinct shapes. "Art Gallery" vibe. |
| **Body (p, li)** | **DM Sans** | Regular (400) | Geometric, low-contrast, highly legible. |
| **Code / Tech** | **JetBrains Mono**| Medium (500) | For technical details, emphasizing the "system" aspect. |

**Typography Rules:**
*   **H1:** 8rem+ (Desktop). Massive. Overlapping other elements is allowed.
*   **Line Quality:** All headers usually accompanied by a thick (2px-4px) underline or geometric primitive.

## 4. 🧩 UI Components

### Buttons & Actions
*   **The "Primitive" Button:** Buttons are rarely just text. They are shapes.
    *   *Primary:* A solid geometric shape (Square or Circle) with centered text. No rounded corners on squares (0px radius).
    *   *Interaction:* On click, the button physically depresses (y-axis translation) + sharp color shift.
*   **Cursor:** Custom cursor. A large stroke circle or crosshair that reacts to magnetic elements.

### The "Card"
*   **Style:** Thick borders (2px solid `#121212`). Minimal padding.
*   **Shadow:** Hard drop shadows (No blur). `box-shadow: 8px 8px 0px #002FA7`.
*   **Hover:** Shadow snaps to `0px`, card moves `8px 8px` to simulate being pressed flat.

### Navigation
*   **Deconstructed Nav:** Navigation items are scattered or stacked like building blocks, rather than a traditional top bar.
*   **Sticky Blocks:** Nav elements follow the user but collide with content "walls".

## 5. 🕹 Interaction & Physics

This is the defining feature of the theme.

*   **Library:** `Matter.js` or `Framer Motion` (layout animations).
*   **Gravity:** Hero elements fall into place on load.
*   **Draggable:** Users can pick up project cards and throw them.
*   **Collision:** Scrolling isn't just vertical translation; it pushes elements out of the way.

---

## 6. 📐 Layout System

*   **The Modular Grid:** Visible grid lines (`1px solid #E5E5E5`).
*   **Asymmetry:** Layouts are balanced but rarely symmetrical. A large circle on the left might be balanced by a dense text block on the far right.
*   **Spacing:** Large, dramatic whitespace.

## 7. 💻 Implementation Guide (Tailwind Config)

```ts
// tailwind.config.ts extension
theme: {
  colors: {
    gallery: "#F2F0E9",
    ink: "#121212",
    klein: "#002FA7",
    signal: "#FF2400",
    bauhaus: "#FFD700",
  },
  fontFamily: {
    display: ["Syne", "sans-serif"],
    body: ["DM Sans", "sans-serif"],
    mono: ["JetBrains Mono", "monospace"],
  },
  boxShadow: {
    'brutal': '8px 8px 0px 0px #121212',
    'brutal-hover': '4px 4px 0px 0px #121212',
    'brutal-klein': '8px 8px 0px 0px #002FA7',
  }
}
```
