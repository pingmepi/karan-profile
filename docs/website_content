## Case Study Page: `/case-studies/event-funnels-cms`

### Hero

* **Title:** Event Funnels & SEO-first Event CMS
* **Summary:** Redesigned event journeys and shipped an SEO-first Event CMS integrated with CRM & Zoom to improve registrations and reduce ops overhead.
* **KPIs:** **+90% registrations** · **Significant revenue impact** · **+25% event→QL** · **40+ events/mo**
* **Tags:** Product Strategy · Event Automation · Funnel Optimisation · SEO · CRM

### Overview

Fragmented journeys and login loops hurt conversions. I led the product work—reframed the funnel, set success metrics, and delivered an SEO-focused Event CMS to make events self-serve.

### Context & Role

* Companies: AlmaBetter (funnel/registrations), Miles Education (Event CMS)
* Role: Lead PM / Program Manager (CTO’s Office)
* Teams: Marketing, CRM, Engineering, Design, Ops

### Problem

* Registration friction (Google login loops; multi-step forms)
* Manual event creation; uneven SEO
* Broken attribution between events → CRM

### Objectives

* Increase registrations and lead quality
* Enable self-serve event creation and promotion
* Preserve clean attribution into CRM

### Product Decisions

* Prioritised **1-click registration** and form simplification over heavy pre-qualification.
* Standardised SEO templates and promo blocks to scale content quickly.
* Enforced UTM discipline and event→CRM mapping before adding new channels.

### Solution

* 1-click registration with inline email validation (n8n)
* Removed Google login loop; simplified forms; conditional fields
* Lifecycle journeys (WebEngage) + WABA fallback
* Event CMS (Strapi + Next.js): SEO templates; CRM & Zoom integration
* Attribution plumbing: UTM-consistent links; event→CRM normalisation

### Architecture

Next.js (web) → Strapi (CMS) → CRM & Zoom APIs · n8n for validation/reminders/tagging · UTM → CRM fields → Metabase.

### Flows

* Registration → Validation → CRM write → Reminder → Attendance sync
* Event creation → SEO page publish → CRM/Zoom sync

### Metrics & Impact

* **+90% registrations**
* **Significant revenue impact** within a 4-month window
* **+25%** event→qualified-lead conversion
* **40+** events/month via CMS

### Evidence

GA4 funnel; CRM opportunity mapping; Metabase cohorts; Zoom attendance logs.

### Challenges & Trade-offs

Form length vs qualification; SEO editorial guardrails; syncing across Zoom & CRM.

### Lessons

UTM discipline matters as much as UX; self-serve needs templates + validation.

### Next

Auto-generated session snippets; reminder cadence A/B; AI agenda builder.

### Artifacts

Funnel diagram; CMS schema; UTM spec; SEO template; n8n registration flow.

### Tech

Strapi · Next.js · n8n · WebEngage · WABA · Zoom API · GA4 · Postgres/Metabase · CRM

## Case Study Page: `/case-studies/martech-revamp-attribution`

### Hero

* **Title:** Martech Revamp for Attribution Accuracy
* **Summary:** Re-architected GA4/Netcore/HubSpot/Metabase for clean attribution, faster reporting, and better lead quality.
* **KPIs:** **+20% lead quality** · **25% faster reporting** · **−40% CRM duplicates**
* **Tags:** Martech · Attribution · Analytics · Data Quality

### Overview

Attribution was inconsistent and reporting slow. I owned the product roadmap for measurement and rebuilt the data path to trust outcomes—daily.

### Context & Role

* Company: Miles Education
* Role: Program Manager (CTO’s Office)

### Problem

Mixed UTM taxonomies; duplicate contacts; manual reporting.

### Objectives

Single source of truth; faster, self-serve reporting.

### Product Decisions

* Mandated a pragmatic UTM spec; wrote guardrails into tooling (link builders, validation).
* Prioritised dedupe and enrichment before advanced analytics to avoid compounding errors.

### Solution

UTM standard + link governance; n8n enrichment (normalisation, tagging, dedupe); Metabase dashboards on Postgres; monthly audits.

### Architecture

Ingest (web/app) → GA4 → ETL (n8n) → CRM + Postgres → Metabase.

### Metrics & Impact

**+20%** lead quality · **25%** faster reporting · **−40%** CRM duplicates.

### Evidence

Pre/post UTM compliance; dedupe logs; dashboard load times; QBR snippets.

### Challenges

UTM enforcement across many operators; legacy campaigns.

### Lessons

Specs are necessary; enforcement via tools is sufficient.

### Next

MMM-style blended ROI; anomaly detection on campaigns.

### Artifacts

UTM spec; enrichment flow; dedupe logic; dashboards.

### Tech

## Case Study Page: `/case-studies/scheduling-at-scale`

### Hero

* **Title:** Multi-Tenant Scheduling Microservice
* **Summary:** Dynamic slot logic + CRM sync reduced ops load and accelerated lead→meeting.
* **KPIs:** **70% ops reduction** · **1,000+ meetings/mo** · **25% faster lead→meeting**
* **Tags:** Platform · SaaS Infra · Ops Automation

### Overview

Manual scheduling slowed growth teams. I wrote the PRD, set success metrics, and led delivery across teams.

### Context & Role

Internal product for sales & academic teams; cross-functional leadership.

### Problem

Spreadsheet slots; inconsistent rules; no auditability.

### Objectives

Self-serve booking; consistent rules; unified audit trail.

### Product Decisions

* Declarative slot logic with test cases; auditability as a first-class requirement.
* CRM as source of truth for people/state; scheduler as orchestration layer.

### Solution

Next.js + Supabase (RBAC, calendars, conflict checks); n8n triggers (reminders, reschedules, tagging); CRM sync + API fallback; webhooks; audit logs.

### Architecture

Scheduler service ↔ CRM ↔ n8n ↔ Notification providers.

### Metrics & Impact

**70%** ops reduction · **1,000+** meetings/mo · **25%** faster lead→meeting.

### Evidence

Ops time studies; CRM event logs; scheduler audits.

### Challenges

Multi-team priorities; timezones; overlap edge cases.

### Lessons

Testable slot logic and audit trails prevent regressions at scale.

### Next

Pool routing; no-show rebooking; lead-score-aware slot boosting.

### Artifacts

Slot-logic diagram; RBAC matrix; audit log examples.

### Tech

Next.js · Supabase (Auth/RLS) · n8n · Webhooks · CRM

* **Summary:** Users generate wearable designs from prompts with live preview and saved sessions.
* **KPIs:** **MVP in 8 weeks** · **100+ testers** · **3.4 designs/session (first session avg)**
* **Tags:** AI · Consumer · Commerce

### Overview

A solo build exploring AI-assisted design → purchase flows with a friction-light canvas UI.

### Context & Role

Solo PM/IC: market hypothesis, UX, MVP scope, validation loops.

### Problem

Cold-start creativity; session persistence; safe prompts.

### Objectives

Fast ideation → preview; save/share; low latency.

### Product Decisions

* Kept profiles RLS-secured for safety and portability.

### Solution

React + Canvas customiser; GPT for ideation; Supabase Auth/RLS; order model (size/SKU/pricing); token accounting + retries.

### Architecture

React FE ↔ Supabase (Auth/DB/Storage) ↔ Prompt service ↔ Order service.

### Metrics & Impact

**100+** testers; **3.4** designs per first session; qualitative feedback: playful & fast.

### Evidence

Event logs (session length, saves); prompt error rates; order funnel.

### Challenges

Prompt safety; rendering performance on low-end devices.

### Lessons

Preview latency trumps model fanciness for novice users.

### Next

Template marketplace; social share; checkout experiments.

### Artifacts

System diagram; schema; error-handling strategy; UI loop video.

### Tech

React · Canvas API · Supabase (Auth/RLS/Storage) · GPT

### Hero

* **Title:** Community Infra — Events, Badges, Hosts, Referrals
* **Summary:** RBAC-first architecture with privacy-centric visibility.
* **KPIs:** **Decoupled role/badge logic** · **Closed beta live**
* **Tags:** Platform · Community · Privacy UX

### Overview

Infra for communities to run events with assigned hosts, badges, and optional participant visibility.

### Context & Role

Architect & PM; admin-only edits by design.

### Problem

Role/badge coupling; visibility/privacy requirements; host workflows.

### Objectives

Separation of concerns; admin-only edits; privacy by default.

### Product Decisions

* Badge system separate from roles; one host per event; admin assignment.
* Visibility flags enforced at API layer; no participant data sent by default.

### Solution

RBAC model; visibility filters; Google Sign-In; preferences endpoint; storage-efficient activity logging.

### Architecture

Supabase (RLS) + Next.js; endpoints for events/hosts/badges; admin console.

### Metrics & Impact

Clean governance; beta usage across growing communities.

### Evidence
