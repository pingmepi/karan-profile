# REVISED WEBSITE PRD (COMMUNITY INSIDE PHILOSOPHY)


Final structure:

```
/
├── /work
├── /products
├── /agentic
├── /life
├── /about
└── /contact
```

Community + MyThirdPlace philosophy moves into `/about`.

Clean.

# 1. HOMEPAGE (Refined Again)

We fix hero + signal.

## Hero

Strip abstraction. Make it grounded.

Large line:

> I build systems that bring order to chaos.

Subline:

Across growth infrastructure, automation, AI workflows, and new product bets.

Primary CTA:
Explore Work
Secondary:
See What I’m Building

No third button.

---

## Replace “Signal Strip” With “Where I’ve Worked on Systems”

Four clean blocks:

**Marketing Orchestration**
Event-driven comms infra across CRM, WhatsApp, analytics.

**Growth Systems**
Event engine → ₹9M impact, funnel instrumentation, UTM normalization.

**Platform Builds**
CMS platforms, scheduling service, workflow state machines.

**AI Workflows**
LLM orchestration, NLP2SQL, generative pipelines.

Metrics live inside each page, not screaming in a banner.

Feels less LinkedIn.

---

## Current Product Bets Section

Short, honest.

> Currently Building

* MyThirdPlace — community & events infrastructure
* MereKapade — AI-assisted commerce experiment
* AI orchestration workflows

No drama.

---

# 2. WORK (`/work`)

Only shipped, production systems.

No philosophy.
No personal.
No unfinished experiments.

Structured, operator-level documentation.

---

# 3. PRODUCTS (`/products`)

This is where MyThirdPlace leads.

Order:

1. MyThirdPlace (primary)
2. MereKapade
3. AI workflow systems
4. In-progress builds

MyThirdPlace should not feel like a side project. It should feel like a deliberate product direction.

---

# 4. AGENTIC (`/agentic`)

Cleaner now because philosophy lives elsewhere.

Structure:

1. Why structure precedes autonomy
2. Mapping my systems to agentic capabilities
3. What I’m exploring now

Keep it technical.
Keep it short.

---

# 5. LIFE (`/life`)

Photography and riding. Separate sections within one page.

No metaphors.
No forced justification.
Just curated identity.

---

# 6. ABOUT (`/about`)

This is where philosophy lives.

This page becomes important.

---

## ABOUT STRUCTURE

### A. Professional Arc

Short, tight narrative:

Execution → Systems → Orchestration → Product bets → AI direction.

No resume copy.

---

### B. Philosophy

This is where community lives.

Structure it in three pillars.

---

#### 1. Structure Over Noise

You value clarity.
You dislike ambiguous systems.
You instrument things.
You design state transitions.

Short, precise.

---

#### 2. Autonomy With Guardrails

You’re interested in autonomy.
But you don’t trust chaos.
You care about evaluation, cost, failure containment.

This ties to agentic direction.

---

#### 3. The Third Place

Here community enters.

Not as a separate feature.
As belief.

Explain:

* Work and home are not enough.
* People need shared spaces.
* You’ve experienced that through communities.
* That belief led to building MyThirdPlace.

This is where it belongs.

Not on a standalone tab.

---

### C. Outside Work

Short mention:

* Photography
* Riding

Just facts.
No metaphors.
